Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to better utilize AI models. Designing effective prompts is critical to the success of prompt engineering, and it can significantly improve the AI model's performance on specific tasks. Providing relevant, specific, unambiguous, and well structured prompts can help the model better understand the context and generate more accurate responses.

For example, if we want an OpenAI model to generate product descriptions, we can provide it with a detailed description that describes the features and benefits of the product. By providing this context, the model can generate more accurate and relevant product descriptions.

Prompt engineering can also help mitigate bias and improve fairness in AI models. By designing prompts that are diverse and inclusive, we can ensure that the model isn't biased towards a particular group or perspective.

In addition, prompt engineering can help us understand which references the model uses to generate its response. Generative AI models have a ton of parameters and the logic it follows is largely unknown to users, so it can be confusing how it arrives at the response it gives. By designing prompts that are easy to understand and interpret, we can help humans better understand how the model is generating its responses. This can be particularly important in domains such as healthcare, where it's critical to understand how the model is making decisions.
